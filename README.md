# Exercises for the AI Workshop held at FEI, VSB-TU Ostrava.

Feel free to [contact me](radek.svoboda@vsb.cz) if you have any questions or want to discuss any topic from the course 😊

All authorship is mentioned where possible.

## Content of the workshop
The aim of the workshop is to get an overview of data analysis and deep learning techniques in the generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) domain.

We will use [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

The exercise will cover these topics:
* GenAI tools for image data using Huggingface models
<!-- * LLM usage for text generating with Huggingface API -->
* Vector representation of text data and searching for similar words using vector distance 
* Design of own deep learning model for generating "Harry Potter"-like text using Keras framework from scratch
